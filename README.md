Anthony's Chilli Con Carne
==========================

This dish is best served at least the day after cooking, since it gives the spices time to infuse the pot.  Suggest serving on bed of rice, bed of egg noodles, or just with bread.

Need large cooking pot, even when cooking small amount, because I find the volume varies slightly all the time.  For the large pot you saw me use, the ingredients below filled it about 3/5ths full and should do about 10 to 12 servings.


Ingredients
-----------

* 1,5 Kg lean/medium ground beef
* 4 regular size yellow onions, diced
* 1 stalk of celery, of which I used 7 branches, diced
* 2 large green peppers, diced
* 1 head of garlic
* 1 500ml can of red kidney beans
* 4 280ml cans Campbell's tomato soup
* 4 150ml tins tomato paste.
* Some cooking oil, like sunflower oil.

NOTE: I keep handy in cupboard extra small cans of tomato soup, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, which are used thin / thicken the chilli, add volume, and/or colour depending of number of people.

* Cayenne Pepper
* Chilli Spice
* Jamaican Allspice
* Paprika
* Herbs de Provence (aka Italian Herbs)
* Salt
* Black Pepper (optional)


Preparation
-----------

1. Prepare all vegetables in advance.

2. In bowl mix 2 table spoons chilli, 1.5 table spoon allspice, 1 table spoon cayenne (more if you want hotter, can be added later), 3 table spoons of herbs, 1 small spoon salt to start (can add more later).

3. Heat cooking oil in pot (heat 7/10) and start to brown onions, but not completely.

4. Once onions start to glaze, stir in paprika (~1 table spoon) to give nice even colour to onions.  Stir, careful not to burn.

5. Slowly add meat, browning the meat in sections, breaking up clumps, and mixing onions well with meat.

6. Once meat starts to brown, slowly stir in about 3/4 of spice bowl in stages.  Should give a brownish colour to the meat and be mixed in evenly.  Make sure to get meat at very bottom of pot, careful that it not burn.

7. Stir in 3 cans of tomato soup (save 4th), should have a cherry/pinkish red colour at this stage.  The Campbell's soup gives a nice glaze to the dish.  Plain canned tomato sauce can be used as a replacement, but you might need some sugar if the chilli starts to taste acidic. 

8. Stir in 3 cans of tomato paste (save 4th).  This will thicken the chilli and give it a nice deeper red colour combined with spices.

9. Mix in celery, green peppers, red kidney beans.  Stir them all in very well.  Note the heat is 7/10 so now you can bring to low heat about 1/10 or 2/10.

10. Let simmer 5 minutes or so.  If the chilli is too thick, add some or all of the 4th soup can.  If becomes to thin, add tomato paste or cook longer to evaporate some liquid.

11. Pot should simmer and bubble a little, make sure to stir very bottom of pot to avoid anything burning at the bottom.

12. Now mix in crushed garlic; I like lots, so typically use a whole head, but varies according to personal preference.

13. Add remaining 1/4 bowl of spices.  Stir well.  Taste occasionally, add salt to taste.

14. Let simmer on lowest heat for about an hour; stir occasionally.

15. Turn off heat and let cool at least two hours (over night if possible) before dividing into containers.


Can be kept in fridge about 7 days; can also be frozen in freezer for longer.
